  # Fix User Preferences RLS Policies for Clerk Authentication

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing RLS policies that don't work with Clerk
    - Create new RLS policies that work with public access for authenticated users
    - Allow users to manage their own preferences based on user_id matching

  2. Changes
    - Remove dependency on auth.uid() which doesn't work with Clerk
    - Use simpler RLS policies that check user_id directly
    - Ensure users can create, read, and update their own preferences
