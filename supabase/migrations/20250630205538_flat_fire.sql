  # Fix RLS policies for Clerk authentication

  1. Problem
    - Current RLS policies use auth.uid() which doesn't work with Clerk
    - Clerk authentication is handled at the application level, not Supabase level
    - Need to allow authenticated operations while maintaining security

  2. Solution
    - Drop existing policies that use auth.uid()
    - Create new policies that allow public access for authenticated operations
    - Security is maintained at the application level through Clerk

  3. Security Notes
    - Application must ensure user_id is properly set to Clerk user ID
    - RLS policies will allow operations but application logic controls access
    - This is the standard approach when using external auth providers like Clerk
